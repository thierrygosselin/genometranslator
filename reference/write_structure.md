# Write a structure file from a tidy data frame

Write a structure file from a tidy data frame Used internally in
[genometranslator](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/genometranslator)
and [assigner](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/assigner) and might be
of interest for users.

## Usage

``` r
write_structure(data, pop.levels = NULL, filename = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A tidy data frame object in the global environment or a tidy data
  frame in wide or long format in the working directory. *How to get a
  tidy data frame ?* Look into genometranslator
  [`tidy_genome`](https://thierrygosselin.github.io/genometranslator/reference/tidy_genome.md).

- pop.levels:

  (optional, string) This refers to the levels in a factor. In this
  case, the id of the pop. Use this argument to have the pop ordered
  your way instead of the default alphabetical or numerical order. e.g.
  `pop.levels = c("QUE", "ONT", "ALB")` instead of the default
  `pop.levels = c("ALB", "ONT", "QUE")`. White spaces in population
  names are replaced by underscore. Default: `pop.levels = NULL`.

- filename:

  (optional) The file name prefix for the structure file written to the
  working directory. With default: `filename = NULL`, the date and time
  is appended to `radiator_structure_`. Default: `filename = NULL`.

- ...:

  other parameters passed to the function.

## Value

A structure file is saved to the working directory.

## Data filtering

This writer does not silently filter markers or individuals. It may
validate requirements imposed by the destination format and stop with an
informative error when the input is unsuitable. It is the user's
responsibility to filter and quality-control the data appropriately for
the intended analysis before generating the output. Use
[radr](https://thierrygosselin.github.io/radr/) or another suitable
workflow when filtering is required.

## Dependencies

Required package dependencies are declared in `DESCRIPTION` and are
installed with genometranslator. Any additional dependency needed only
for this format or option is identified in this help page. Use
[`genometranslator_dependencies()`](https://thierrygosselin.github.io/genometranslator/reference/genometranslator_dependencies.md)
to inspect the availability of core packages, optional packages, and
external executables.
